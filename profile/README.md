The following message has been relayed by Simonas. 

Hello dear builders of Decidim from around the world gathered in Barcelona! 💙

As a back-story, [Open Source Politics](https://github.com/OpenSourcePolitics) and [PokeCode](https://github.com/openpoke/) convened everyone on this telegram chat in order to collaborate more between companies contributing to Decidim.

Yesterday some of us met for an evening workshop to discuss how we could collaborate. We arrived at three main pillars of it:

* Collective Gem management
* Transparent co-financing of solutions
* Joint regular communication

Commitments from Francesco, [PokeCode](https://github.com/openpoke/), [
Mainio Tech](https://github.com/mainio/), 
Octree and of course [Open Source Politics](https://github.com/OpenSourcePolitics) came out of this. You can see them resumed in the Notion page dedicated to yesterday’s meeting.

We would like to ask the commiters to fill in some details about their commitments (deadline, to-do list, etc.).

For those that couldn’t be present yesterday, feel free to add more commitments and assign them to yourself.

Tomorrow we’ll have the Decidim association meeting - let’s mention the creation of this group, our main commitments and ask to have a space on metadecidim.

☀️This little community might change a lot about how we work and the progress that Decidim achieves so I invite you to stay connected and actively involved.
